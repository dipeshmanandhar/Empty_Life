Nothing to do but finish a maze~~~

**This game makes a maze of arbitrary size (as dictated by the user) using a randomized version of Prim's Algorithm. The player is represented by a blue dot and must travel from one end of the maze to the other end.**

A 20 x 10 (width x height) sample maze generated by the algorithm is shown below:

The game also asks the user whether they wish to play in "Kid Mode" or not. The only difference in "Kid Mode" is that the path taken by the player is shown in red, as shown below:

The maze still looks reasonable for a wide range of input sizes, as seen in this maze of size 100x50:
